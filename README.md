# Predict Cancer Mortality Rates in US Counties

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting cancer mortality rates in US counties. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze and predict cancer mortality rates based on various features associated with different counties.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the machine learning model.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **`results/`**: Store the model weights, evaluation metrics, and any other relevant results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. (Specify versions in `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/predict-cancer-mortality.git
    cd predict-cancer-mortality
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Make sure to place your dataset in the `data/` directory or update the data loading code accordingly.

2. **Training the Model**:

    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py
    ```

3. **Evaluation**:

    ```bash
    python src/evaluate_model.py
    ```

4. **Inference**:

    ```bash
    python src/predict.py
    ```

## Results

Include key findings, visualizations, and evaluation metrics here. Discuss the performance of the model and any insights gained.
